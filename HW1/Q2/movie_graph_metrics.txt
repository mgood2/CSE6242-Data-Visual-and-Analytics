Briefly explain the intuitive meaning:

¦ Average node degree: The degree of a node is the number of relation (edge) it has.
Thus this metric refers to the average degree that each node has.

¦ Diameter of the graph: This metric refers to the maximum connection between two 
most distant nodes in the network.

¦ Average path length: This metric refers to the average connected path length between
arbitrary two nodes by measuring the shortest path.
