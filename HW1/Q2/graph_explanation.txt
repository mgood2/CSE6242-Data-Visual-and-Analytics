b.Describing your choice of visualization, using fewer than 50 words.

Answer: In this graph, I choose the Fruchterman Reingold model. In this model,
the movie data can be displayed properly by following the requirements like minimum
edge crossing, roughly same edge length, straight line edges, compactness and symmetry.
Besides by adjusting the elements's color and size, I make the graph easy to visualize.
